# personal_finance_app

Hi! I am developing a personal project: app to track personal finances in Python. 
I try to practice OOP in this project.
To do:
- Serializing the account and registry so you can access the data after exiting the program
- Main script that runs the program as a console application with argparse
- Class for the whole application, running the program will create an instance of it
- GUI
- Enclosing the app into a package and submitting it to PIP
